🧠 AI-Powered Collective Intelligence Polling System
A smart polling platform that goes beyond percentages to analyze crowd behavior, amplify intelligent minority opinions, and predict future trends using AI and statistical analysis.

📌 Overview
Traditional polling applications only display vote percentages, which limits understanding of why people vote a certain way or how opinions may change over time.
This project enhances standard polling by combining statistical analysis, minority weighting, trend prediction, and AI-generated explanations — while still preserving normal percentage-based results.

✨ Key Features
✅ Percentage-Based Poll Results
#Displays total votes and option-wise percentages
#Pie / bar chart visualization
#Ensures transparency and fairness

📊 Statistical Vote Analysis
#Measures opinion diversity and polarization
#Detects early-vote bias and opinion instability
#Helps interpret how strong or weak a majority really is

🧠 Minority Weighting (Core Innovation)
#Tracks historical prediction accuracy of users
#Assigns higher analytical weight to reliable voters
#Identifies intelligent minority opinions
#Does NOT change actual vote percentages

🔮 Opinion Trend Prediction
#Analyzes how vote percentages change over time
#Predicts possible final outcome using trend analysis
#Displays projected results graphically

📝 AI-Generated Explanation
#Converts numerical results into simple English insights
Explains:
#Majority behavior
