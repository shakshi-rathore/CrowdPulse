# 🧠 CROWDPULSE :AI-Powered Intelligence Polling System

A smart polling platform that goes beyond percentages to analyze crowd behavior, amplify intelligent minority opinions, and predict future trends using AI and statistical analysis.

## 📌 Overview

Traditional polling applications only display vote percentages, which limits understanding of why people vote a certain way or how opinions may change over time.

This project enhances standard polling by combining statistical analysis, minority weighting, trend prediction, and AI-generated explanations — while still preserving normal percentage-based results.

## ✨ Key Features
### ✅ Percentage-Based Poll Results

- Displays total votes and option-wise percentages

- Pie / bar chart visualization

- Ensures transparency and fairness

### 📊 Statistical Vote Analysis

- Measures opinion diversity and polarization

- Detects early-vote bias and opinion instability

- Helps interpret how strong or weak a majority really is

### 🧠 Minority Weighting (Core Innovation)

- Tracks historical prediction accuracy of users

- Assigns higher analytical weight to reliable voters

- Identifies intelligent minority opinions

- Does NOT change actual vote percentages

### 🔮 Opinion Trend Prediction

- Analyzes how vote percentages change over time

- Predicts possible final outcome using trend analysis
